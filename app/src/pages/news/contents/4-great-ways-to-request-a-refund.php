                        <p class="text p">The first step to request a refund is to simply ask. In most cases there will already be a process in place for customers who request refunds. Politely give customer service a call (calls usually receive a better response than emails) and explain why you want a refund.</p>

                        <div class="h-text mb-10">2. GET SUPERVISOR INVOLVED</div>
                        <p class="text p">If the first person you speak with is unable to get you the refund then get a supervisor involved. In some cases, customer service employees may not have the power to issue a refund. This is when speaking to a supervisor would be most helpful in getting a favorable response.</p>

                        <div class="h-text mb-10">3. GIVE THEM A REASON</div>
                        <p class="text p">In a recent video by Greg Schinkel, he explains the importance of why. In his review of a Harvard case study, he found over 94% of people granted a request just because they explained why. Furthermore, it did not matter how strong the “why” was, people just needed a reason to help.</p>
