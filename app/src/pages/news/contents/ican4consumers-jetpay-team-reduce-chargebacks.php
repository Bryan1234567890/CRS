We believe that JetPay’s extensive reach into the ecommerce payments landscape will bring iCAN4Consumers to those merchants that need it most,”“iCAN4Consumers will reduce chargeback levels for our merchants that would gladly issue a credit to a consumer, if given the opportunity. Unfortunately, in most instances today, when a consumer is dissatisfied with a product or service, the first thing they do is contact their card issuing bank. We believe that consumers will be attracted to and utilize the iCAN4C service because it is independent and not tied to the merchant. This will keep merchants under the association chargeback threshold levels and reduce costs.”</p>
