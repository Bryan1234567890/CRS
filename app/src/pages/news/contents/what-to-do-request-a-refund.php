                        <span class="text">One of the primary factors by which you should judge a retailer is on its return policy. It shows that they are committed to customer service and that they stand by their product. If you are unable to request or secure a refund, other alternatives are available. It is essential that you have these avenues of recourse, given that consumers return over $264 billion worth of merchandise every year.

                        <p class="text p">If something goes awry with your purchase and you can’t request a refund from the website, look for the “About Us” or “Contact Us” section of the website for email addresses and phone numbers. Then, call the merchant’s customer service directly – often, a webmaster is associated with the website, and the merchant only has a moderate role in keeping it running. It should not take more than 5-7 business days for them to return your call, and fewer to return your email. If they value your patronage, a refund will be quickly issued.</p>

                        <p class="text p">Sometimes, a retailer will try to give you the “run-around.” When you request a refund, if you feel that the communication isn’t fruitful or that you can’t get a timely response, then it’s time to escalate. Investigate what options the bank that issued your credit card provides; contact their customer support group to determine their recommended course of action. Depending on your dispute with the merchant, you may be required to complete a set of forms and/or follow other procedures set forth by your issuing bank in order to obtain a refund.</p>
